CS 1026 - Assignment 2 â€“ Password Strength
Code by: Muniver Kaur Kharod
******************************
This file is used to calculate the strength of a password based on the
number of character groups it contains and its length. It includes a helper
function to count the character groups and a main function to compute the password
strength using these group counts and the password's length. The strength is returned
as an integer between 0 and 5.
